Brain Canada Report Generation

The publication list is generated using an automated procedure summarized below:

1)  PMID, PMCID, and/or DOI determined by searching in 1)  PubMed and 2) Google scholar (if article not yet indexed in PubMed).

2)  Citation metadata downloaded in JSON and/or BibTex format from first available source (PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, arXiv, etc.)

3)  Duplicate articles are removed.

4)  Article PDF downloaded from first available source (PubMed Central, publisher web page, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, arXiv).

5)  Article PDF is text-mined to extract scanning platforms, funding acknowledgements, other ackowledgements, and author contributions.

6)  The extracted information is manually reviewed for accuracy by the database curators.

7)  Tabulated article lists are sent to authors for verification, and to add missing information if required.

Notes:

BIC_AUTHORS

The "BIC_AUTHORS" field includes BIC Faculty, PIs who are registered users of BIC core facilities, and BIC staff members who co-author papers.  It does not include graduate students, trainees, and collaborators from other institutions who are not BIC faculty or registered core users.  This is determined from the author list in PubMed.

BIC_PLATFORMS

The "BIC_PLATFORMS" field indicates scanning platforms that are mentioned (as being used) in the text of a publication and/or supplementary materials.  In the case of large multi-site clinical trials, the scanning sites are not always indicated.  When data from an existing repository such as ADNI or HCP is used, this is indexed separately and not counted as new primary data acquired on a BIC scanning platform.  An exception to this arises when a BIC scanning platform remains in service as active sites in an ongoing repository project (eg. GENFI).

While the use of imaging and radiochemistry platforms is easy to identify, the use of BIC Computing platforms is generally not explicitly stated and requires confirmation from the authors.  When a BIC imaging platform is used, it is assumed that BIC Computing services are also used (at least) for data retrieval.

BC_PSG_ACKNOWLEDGED

The "BC_PSG_ACKNOWLEDGED"  field is based on acknowledgement text extracted from the PDF.  The value is "YES" if the Brain Canada PSG is explicitly mentioned.  Other Brain Canada funding (investigator grants, MIRI) is not counted.

BC_REASON_NOT_ACKNOWLEDGED

This field is requested by Brain Canada for publications that do not acknowledge support from the Brain Canada PSG.

In many such publications, use of PSG-funded infrastructure is documented (eg radiochemistry, Prisma, MEG) even though the funding is not acknowledged.  By default, an explanation such as the following will be entered:  "Indirect publication using one or more PSG-funded imaging platforms".

Because the IT infrastructure is often not described, we rely on the authors to add this information in the circulated tables so that the publication can be attributed to the PSG funding.
